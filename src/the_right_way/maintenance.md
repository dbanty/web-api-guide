TODO

- Great developer documentation
- Clear, active notification of updates, especially security update
- Ongoing development to respond to bugs as they are found
- Use of tools to prevent bugs (e.g. static analysis, automated testing)
- A clear way to report on, work on, and fix suspected vulnerabilities privately to protect users until it's safe to announce.
- A roadmap of the path forward for the project
- Transparency about the development process and speed
