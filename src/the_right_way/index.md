# The Right Way

This is the no compromises, unapologetic, idealistic section of the guide. Here we will dive into everything it takes to make a truly great web API without committing to any specific technologies or standards. The individual topics are presented in no particular order, _all_ are important.

The point of this section is to serve as a sort of rubric for comparing available solutions when designing a new web API. The intention is that this section remains relatively static throughout the churn of technology by emphasizing design principles rather than specific problems and solutions. This section might also serve as general guidance for implementing a new solution, though further research will inevitably be required to turn these abstract ideas into something concrete.
